# For fungal ITS sequencing we employed PIPITS for read joining, ITS sequence extraction, and OTU clustering
# We then used BROCC for taxonomic assignment.
# Below is the workflow used for the stent biofilm microbiome paper. For explanation and implementation please see the full documentation documents
# PIPITS full documentation: https://github.com/eclarke/pipits
# BROCC full documentation: https://github.com/kylebittinger/brocc

## PIPITS
# Obtain sample list from an input of per sample demultiplexed FASTQ files
pipits_getreadpairslist -i ILLUMINA_DEMULTIPLEXED_FASTQ -o ReadPairList.txt

# Run QC and read pairing
pipits_prep -i ILLUMINA_DEMULTIPLEXED_FASTQ -o PIPITS_PREP -l ReadPairList.txt -t 16

# Extract ITS sequences; -x parameter is the ITS region sequenced
pipits_funits -i PIPITS_PREP/prepped.fasta -x ITS1 -p $HOME/miniconda3/envs/pipits/opt/ITSx_db/HMMs -t 18

# By default, this uses the UNITE database.
pipits_process -i PIPITS_FUNITS/ITS.fasta -t 18

# OTU representative sequences at 97% identity
muscle -maxiters 2 -in pipits_process/repseqs.fasta -out repseqs_aligned.fa

# Phylogenetic tree
fastTree -nt < repseqs_aligned.fa > repseqs_aligned.tre


## BROCC
# Run blast on representative sequences obtained from PIPITS above
blastn -db LOCAL_BLAST_DB -query repseqs.fasta -out REP_SET_BLAST_NT.txt -evalue 1e-5 -outfmt 7 -max_target_seqs 100 -num_threads 10

# Run BROCC
brocc.py -i repseqs.fasta -b REP_SET_BLAST_NT.txt -o BROCC -a ITS
